1)  What is redux ?

==> Redux is an open-source javascript library for mananging the state of an application in a predictable way. It is commonly used with libraries like React for building user interfaces but can be used with any javascript framework or library.


2) Toolkit 

==> The official, opinionated, batteries-included toolset for efficient Redux development.


3) Store 

==> A store is a central place where the state of our application is stored & it can be created using the (configureStore) function, and it holds the entire state tree of our application.
 

4) Slice

==> A slice is a (piece of store) and the corresponding reducer logic to update that state. Slices are a way to organize our Redux store by breaking it down into smaller,more manageable parts.

    Slice Analogy

    ==> Imagine you have a big cake and you want to cut it into smaller, more manageable pieces.
    Each peice is a like a "slice" of the cake. In the context redux toolkit a "slice" is like a smaller part of your application's overall state and the instructions on how to change or update that specific part.


5) initialState

==>Initial state as the name suggest is going to be the "initial" data of our state.


6) Reducers 

==> Reducers are like the instructions on what to do with each slice of the cake.

==> They define how the information in a particular slice cqan be (changed or update )


7) Actions 

==> Actions are like the (requests or commands) you gib=ve to change aspecific slice of the cake.

==> for example, you might have an action called "Eat a Bite" that instructs how to take a bite from a slice.


8) useSelector() Hook

==> useSelector hook allows us to read data from the redux store.


9) useDispatch() Hook 

==> The dispatch function is used to send actions to the store,triggering updates to the 
store, triggering updates to the application state.

==> In simpler terms, it lets you (change the state) in your Redux store from within your React Componnets.


10) Redux Toolkit Query 

==> Redux Toolkit Query (RTK) is specifically designed to simplify data fetching ,caching, and state management for API calls in a react.
